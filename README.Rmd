`opendatascotland` is an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package to download and
locally cache data from the amazing [opendata.scot](https://opendata.scot/)
website. This helps to quickly start data analysis by providing a simple way to
save, organise and import data in R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `opendatascotland` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fozy81/opendatascot")
```

## Search

Search all available datasets by using the `ods_search()` function. Additionally, use the `search` argument to filter datasets by title.

```{r search}
library(opendatascotland)
# View all available datasets and associated metadata
all_datasets <- search_ods()

# Search dataset titles containing matching terms (case insensitive)
single_query <- search_ods("Number of bikes")

# Search multiple terms
multi_query <- search_ods(c("Bins", "Number of bikes"))
head(multi_query, 4)
```

Note, search term is case-insensitive but word order must be correct (there is
no 'fuzzy' matching).

## Download

Currently, only datasets available in `.csv`, `.json` or `.geojson` can be
downloaded. These formats cover the majority of data available. You will be
warned if data can't be downloaded.
  
To download data, you can either download the metadata using `search_ods()`,
then pass that data frame to `get_ods()`

```{r}
query <- search_ods("Grit bins")
data <- get_ods(query)
```

Or use the search argument in `get_ods(search="my search term")` to search and
download matching datasets in one step.

```{r}
data <- get_ods(search = "Grit bins")
```

By default, you will be asked if you want to save the data locally on the first
download. Optionally, you can refresh the data or avoid being asked to save
data.

```r
data <- get_ods(search = "Number of bikes", refresh = TRUE, ask = FALSE)
```
## Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data <- get_ods(search = "Air Quality - Diffusion Tubes")
```

```r
data <- get_ods(search = "Air Quality - Diffusion Tubes")
```
The `get_ods()` function returned a named list of data frames - lets select the
one we want by name:

```{r}
air_tubes <- data$`Air_Quality_-_Diffusion_Tubes_Aberdeen_City_Council`
```

Or alternatively select the first data frame in the list using index of 1.

```{r}
air_tubes <- data[[1]]
```

Geojson datasets are automating converted to  [simple
feature](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) 'sf' data. As we can see in the
example the data frame is classed as "sf" which mean spatial / geometry
coordinates are held in a `geometry` column.

```{r}
class(air_tubes) 
```

These allows the `plot()` function to automatically plot the coordinates in the
geometry column.

```{r}
plot(air_tubes$geometry, 
     col = as.factor(air_tubes$LOCATION))
```
